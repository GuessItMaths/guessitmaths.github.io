                <h2>How to Play & Ideas</h2>
                <p>  There are currently 5 different topics, Number, Polyhedra, Graphs, Algebra & History of Maths. We aim to develop each of these into an easy/medium/hard version, which will then be able to be used with a variety of year groups. The prompt sheets available on the left are perfect to help scaffold some students to higher levels of thinking, or to give you rough script ideas while the students are working through a round.</p>
                <hr> <p>  The History of Maths topic will go together with a few other topics, focusing on pi, the golden ratio & fractals, to provide an indepth look at deeper topics in Mathematics. These topics are perfect for strong students who want to learn more, or to fill bonus lesson/form time.</p>
                <hr> <p>  So how does the game work? It's basically identical to Guess Who except the general gameplay has to be modified slightly to counter for the classroom environment. My personal recommendation is to choose a student to come up to the front (either your desk or the interactive board) and request they think of a card and share it with you. Depending on the topic this may be either a number, a shape, a sketch/fucntion etc. Then from here allow students to either think of a question and do hands up to go through student responses, or request all students to write out a question on a MWB & then you can select students at random. Depending on the ability level, you may need to either add restrictions on the style of questions allowed, or scaffold by giving prompts (Check out the documents across the page!) To turn cards face down, merely touch them. WARNING: they currently can't be turned back face up - so be careful!</p>

                <h2>Future Topics & Other Projects</h2>
                <p>The next developments, once the website is fully launched and the other topics finished, will be to craft different difficulty games within a topic. This may be through a series of different prompt sheets available or through an explicitly different gameboard. After that, the next considerations are as follows.</p>
                <hr> <p>Example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New Topic: Proofs & Trigonometry</li>
                    <li>Interactive Online Versions: Single Player vs. Computer; Improved Class Player; Single Player vs. Computer </li>
                </ul>
                <hr> <p>In other news, we are currently working on another online game that will incorporate mathematics & classic boardgames. Hopefully it will make a splash (pun intended).</p>
